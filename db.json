      "items": "1/2 cup coconut oil (at the same consistency as softened butter)\n1/2 cup sugar\n1 large egg\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt\n1 3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour",
      "steps": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\n\nTo make the crust, mix together the coconut oil and the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat for at least 1 minute, until combined. Scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. Mix in the egg. Next add the vanilla and salt. Mix in the flour a little at a time until all ingredients are combined into a cookie dough. \n\nPress the dough evenly into the sides and bottom of an 11-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Prick the bottom in a few places with a fork. Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes until firm and slightly browned. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. \n\nTo make the filling, place the 4 yolks in a bowl and beat gently with a fork until the yolks break up. Stir together the sugar and cornstarch in a medium saucepan. Stir in the water. Continue to stir and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 1 minute. It will resemble a clear pudding. \n\nSpoon about 2 tablespoons of the warm thickened pudding-like mixture into the egg yolks as you whisk constantly. Add a few more tablespoons and continue to whisk. Finally pour the contents of the bowl with the yolks back into the saucepan and continue to whisk. Whisk in the pineapple juice and stir in the butter. Return to medium and bring back to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, stirring often. \n\nStrain the filling to remove any solids that may have formed when you combined the egg yolks. Stir the chopped pineapple into the strained filling. Pour the filling into the crust and set aside while you make the meringue. \n\nTo make the meringue. Stir together the sugar and water in a medium saucepan over medium-heat until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is clear. Stop stirring and insert a candy thermometer. Allow the syrup to come to 238 degrees F.\n\nWhile the syrup cooks, whisk the egg whites into soft peaks in an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.\n\nOnce the sugar comes to temperature, turn the mixer on low and slowly pour the hot syrup into the egg whites. Turn the mixer to medium-high and whip until a thick meringue forms, about 1 minute. \n\nTransfer the meringue to a piping bag and pipe over the pineapple filling. \n\nBake for 15 minutes or until the meringue is firm and browned. Let the tart cool for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the filling to set up."
